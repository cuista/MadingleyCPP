MadingleyCPP

Version history
0.2 (10/01/2017) - Modifications to MadingleyCPP to set up the human approptiation of NPP. Changes have been propagated in from the madingley-merge-and-refactor C# branch
This needed some extra parameters, so these have been added to SimulationControlParameters.csv viz.
HumanNPPScenarioType
HumanNPPExtractionScale
HumanNPPScenarioDuration
BurninSteps
ImpactSteps
RecoverySteps
and the original HumanNPPExtraction parameter has been removed. HANPP.cpp now gets all these parameters from the Parameters singleton rather than via arguments
