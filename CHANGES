PLANNED FUTURE CHANGES
Primary
- Output grid-based data for all available datums. Are there any other calculations that need to take place?

Secondary
- Move hard-coded constants to Constants.h
- Change DrawRandomly parameter to RandomSeed and use this to seed a centralised random object, accessible via a singleton design pattern.
- Move library directories into the Madingley tree for increased portability.
