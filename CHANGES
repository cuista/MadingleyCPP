Planned Future Changes

- Change DrawRandomly parameter to RandomSeed and use this to seed a centralised random object, accessible via a singleton design pattern.
- Move library directories into the Madingley tree for increased portability.
- Add a configurable data file path for ease of switching to new datasets.
